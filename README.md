# data-structures
The aim of the project is to implement and measure time
the actions of basic operations such as adding, deleting, searching for an element etc. in the following data structures:

1. Dynamic array,
2. Bidirectional list 
3. Heap, 
4. Binary Search Tree (BST) 

The element of all structures is a 4-byte signed integer,
all data structures are dynamically allocated 
and take up minimal space. 

Since the results of some operations depend on the value of the elements, measurements for a specific size are made 10 times, 
each time generating a new random population, the result is 
averaged.
The measurements are
made for 5 representative sizes so that
they reflected the type of relationship (linear, logarithmic). 

*A full description of the project, algorithms, tests and my analyzes of computational complexity can be found in the file: data-structures.pdf
